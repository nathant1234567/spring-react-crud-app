### React Tutorial CRUD Application
##Overview

This is a CRUD application I built using Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and React for the frontend.
It demonstrates RESTful API design, database integration using Spring Data JPA, and entity relationships between Groups, Events, and Users.

I did this project to practice Springboot and see how it is used to build scalable, maintainable web applications with clear folder structures.
